# üõ† Fix Missing Migration File Names in the migrations Table Without Losing Data

Description

If your database tables already exist (with large amounts of data) but the corresponding migration entries are missing from the migrations table, this snippet helps you re-insert the migration names safely.

Instructions

Place the code in your routes/web.php file.

Adjust the path or logic if needed for your project.

Run the route only once to update the migrations table.

Always take a backup of the migrations table before executing.

‚ö†Ô∏è Warning:
Use this snippet only if you‚Äôre experienced and understand the implications. Improper use can lead to inconsistencies between your migration history and database schema.

Why use this?

This approach helps standardize the migrations table without affecting your existing data, ensuring Laravel recognizes your migrations properly.
